# maxnet

Maxent is a stand-alone Java application for modelling species geographic distributions. This open source repository contains an R package, called "maxnet", which implements much of the functionality of the Java application. We welcome contributions to maxnet. The current release of maxnet is also available for download on the CRAN website.

For information on the Maxent application, please see the Maxent home page at the American Museum of Natural History.

[This fork](https://github.com/mmfink/maxnet) of maxnet contains changes from the [original](https://github.com/mrmaxent/maxnet) (see [NEWS.md](NEWS.md)) and was created for my own use. Version tags will be in the form `n.nn-n` to distinguish it from the original (`n.n.n`). This is an unofficial fork not on CRAN. Anyone is welcome to use it and/or contribute to it, but my ability to maintain it is extremely limited.
